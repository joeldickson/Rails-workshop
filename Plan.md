I'll search for the latest Rails 8 features and modern frameworks to give you the most current recommendations.Great workshop topic! Rails 8 with its native Hotwire integration and modern tooling is perfect for demonstrating rapid development. Here are my suggestions for practical workshop exercises:

## Core Stack Recommendations

**1. Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus)**
This is Rails 8's native approach for building modern CRUD interfaces without complex JavaScript. Perfect for showing:
- Turbo Frames for inline editing
- Turbo Streams for live updates
- Stimulus controllers for simple interactivity

**Workshop Exercise**: Build a task management system where you demonstrate adding/editing/deleting tasks without page refreshes in ~30 lines of code.

**2. Rails Scaffolding + Tailwind CSS**
Rails 8 comes with Tailwind integration out of the box. Show how `rails generate scaffold` creates a complete CRUD interface in seconds, then customize it with Tailwind.

**Workshop Exercise**: Generate a Product catalog (name, price, description, category) and transform the default scaffold into a modern UI with minimal effort.

## Enhancement Frameworks

**3. ViewComponent**
ViewComponent with Stimulus creates powerful reusable UI components. Great for showing component-based architecture.

**Workshop Exercise**: Create a reusable data table component that handles sorting, filtering, and pagination.

**4. Avo Admin Framework**
Avo is a modern admin framework that uses a light configuration layer to build CRUD interfaces in 10% of the time. Excellent for demonstrating how little code creates a full admin panel.

**Workshop Exercise**: Build a complete admin dashboard for a blog (posts, comments, users) with search, filters, and actions using just resource configuration files.

## Suggested Workshop Structure

**Exercise 1: "Zero to CRUD in 5 Minutes"**
- `rails new` with default Rails 8 settings
- Generate scaffold for a simple model
- Show the generated code and running app
- **Impact**: Full CRUD in ~10 lines of custom code

**Exercise 2: "Making it Interactive"**
- Add Turbo Frames for inline editing
- Add Turbo Streams for live updates
- Add Stimulus controller for form validation
- **Impact**: Modern SPA-like experience with ~50 lines of code

**Exercise 3: "Admin Panel in Minutes"**
- Install Avo or similar framework
- Configure 2-3 resources
- Add custom actions and filters
- **Impact**: Production-ready admin in ~20 minutes

**Exercise 4: "Componentize Everything"**
- Extract ViewComponents for reusable elements
- Add Stimulus controllers for behavior
- **Impact**: Show maintainability and reusability

This approach demonstrates Rails' "convention over configuration" philosophy and shows how modern Rails competes with (or beats) heavier JavaScript frameworks for time-to-market on CRUD applications.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these frameworks or help you structure a specific workshop exercise?
